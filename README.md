## 🎛 Trend Presets (Real-World Styles)

These are the styles you actually see everywhere — not fashion-week delusion.

### 🖤 Streetwear (Baggy / Oversized Era)
Cargos, hoodies, boxy tees, wide jeans.  
Gender-neutral. Comfort won. End of debate.

### 💿 Y2K Revival
Low-rise for women.  
Baggy denim + graphic tees for men.  
Early-2000s chaos is back and loud.

### 🤍 Quiet Luxury / Old Money
Clean tailoring, muted tones, good fabric.  
Men in polos & trousers.  
Women in blazers & knits.  
Wealth whispers. Boredom sometimes screams.

### 😎 Model-Off-Duty / Effortless Minimal
White tees, denim, sneakers, sunglasses.  
Men look *accidentally hot*.  
Women look *chronically cool*.

### 🧥 90s Minimalism
Straight jeans, leather jackets, slip dresses, plain knits.  
Timeless = always trending.

### 🖤 Indie Sleaze Revival
Leather, messy layering, scarves, skinny jeans (yes, men too).  
“I don’t care” energy that cares a lot.

### 🧱 Grunge / Alt Revival
Band tees, boots, flannel, dark palettes.  
Emotional support outfit for all genders.

### 🧭 Gorpcore / Utility Fashion
Cargo pants, windbreakers, trail sneakers.  
Practical — but somehow hot now.

### 💼 Office Siren / Corporate Baddie
Women: sharp tailoring.  
Men: fitted blazers, trousers, glasses.  
LinkedIn, but make it seductive.

### 💎 Mob Wife / Loud Luxury
Women: fur, gold, drama.  
Men: chains, leather jackets, bold fits.  
Taste optional. Confidence mandatory.

### 🏃 Athleisure / Sporty Chic
Gym fits worn everywhere.  
No one is actually working out.

Carhartt-coded.  
Denim, chore jackets, boots.  
Looks like you know how to fix things (even if you don’t).
